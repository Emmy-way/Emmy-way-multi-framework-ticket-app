# Multi-Framework Ticket Web App

This repository contains a robust ticket management web application built using three distinct frontend technologies: React, Vue.js, and Twig. Each version of the app delivers a seamless user experience, including a welcoming landing page, a secure authentication process, a high-level dashboard, and a full-featured screen for managing tickets (Create, View, Edit, Delete).

This project is designed to showcase mastery in structuring frontend applications, state management, form logic, and UI design consistency across multiple frameworks, while enforcing a uniform layout and design language in all implementations.

## Implementations

This project contains three complete, separate implementations of the same application.

*   **[React](./react-app/)** - A modern implementation using Create React App.
*   **[Vue.js](./vue-app/)** - A progressive implementation using the Vue CLI.
*   **[Twig](./twig-app/)** - A template-based implementation using Twig.js, often used with backend frameworks like Symfony or Laravel.

## Shared Assets

A `shared-assets` directory contains assets used across all three implementations, such as the hero wave SVG and decorative shapes, to ensure design consistency.

*   **[Shared Assets](./shared-assets/)**

## Core Features

*   **Landing Page:** A welcoming page with a wavy hero section.
*   **Authentication:** Simulated Login/Signup with `localStorage`.
*   **Dashboard:** A summary view of ticket statistics.
*   **Ticket Management (CRUD):** A full-featured screen to create, read, update, and delete tickets.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
*   **Consistent UI/UX:** The exact same layout and design rules are applied to each framework version.

## Getting Started
